bicetriz, line that traverse an angle on its middle the angle in two equidistants angles.
mediatriz, perpendicular line to the segment that traverse it on its middle point
altura, line that is perpendicular to a segment and traverse its oposite vortex
mediana, line that traverse the middle point of a segment and its oposite vortex

incentro (bicetriz point) the intersection of the bicetrices of a triangle
circuncentro (mediatriz point) the intersection of the mediatrices of a triangle
ortocentro (alturas point) the intersection of the alturas of a triangle
baricentro (medianas) the intersecton of the medianas of a triangle

axial simetry
a simetric image according to a recta

355
We have 2 axis X and Y +
We have 4 planes in this plane; I, II, III and IV
If we move a point (-2; 3) from II to I we are only making use of Y axis.
The result would be (2; 3) notice that when you use only Y axis it only changes the X value and viversa.

If we move a point (2; 3) from I to III we are only making use of X axis
The result would be (2; -3) notice that when you use only X axis it only changes the Y value and viversa.

358
central simetry. It's like moving angles in 349 but with grade 0. Central simetry is even an easier proces.

362, 363
Traslation
You move a point or group of points but you are given with the segment that they are to be moved with. 
You gotta get the segment distance and direction and then move the points.
In order to get the segment information you should have an square rule and a rule, with the square take the dimensions of the segment and translate it from
the segment to the point keeping the same segment direction. Once you reached the point, you create a new point where the difference from the new point and the old one
is the segment.

370
we have a triangle with vertices A, B, C
We got the sane triangle and we make a bigger one with a razon of 2, Its vertices are A', B' and C'
These triangles are semejantes because their respective angles are the same and their sides keep the same proporcionality
Meaning these: A'/A = B'/B = C'/C = 2
r = 2
ra = r**2
rv = r**3

371
Escale
If we have X' object of scale 1/100 means that X' is 100 times smaller than X
E is the scale:
x'=x*E

E=x/x'
x=x'/E
