-Once in desired folder start new project
git init

-Create new project
-Check git status
git status

-Add new file to be commited
git add fileName.fileType or fileName.fileType fileName.fileType or add * or add *.fileType or add fileName.*

-You can remove the added file
git rm --cached fileName.fileType

-?
git add LICENSE

-Make the commit and write a message about it
git commit -m "Added fileName.fileType"

-get the history of commits for current branch
git log

-When git log the structure of every commit is
commit (commitHashName)
Author: (authorName) <(authorEmail)>
Date: (date)
(commitMessage)

-if you wanna go back to a certain commit of the same branch just
git checkout (commitHashName)
-When we git checkout we are basically leaving our currentBranch and going to another, if you wanna go back just...
git checkout (previousBranch)
-If you do not remember your previousBranch, it probably was master

-If you wanna create a new branch from a certain checkout go to that checkout (it would be like the starting point of that new branch) and
git branch branchName
-That way you created a new branch

-Check branches list
git branch

-If you wanna make a branch1 equal to branch2 by adding branch2 commits to branch1 then
git branch branch1
git merge branch2 -m "(merging message)"

-remove last commit
-https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1338728/delete-commits-from-a-branch-in-git
git reset --hard HEAD~1
-if you are in last commit, this will also remove work in progress from there

-remove last commit from branch
git push origin HEAD --force

-another option
git reset --hard <commit hash>

git reset --hard HEAD~2 
-to remove the last two commits

-connect local git reposotory with an external reposotory
git remote add origin <external repo url>
-now the every git push origin will be directed by default to that external repo

-To actually make changes and commit the commmit there to the external repo we must push
git push -u origin <external branch name>
-If we "git push -u origin master" being master a branch in out external repo and if we where in the branch "javascript" from our local repo then "javascript" 
-will be set as the default branch for external repo "master" branch

-to delete a branch: https://www.cloudbees.com/blog/git-delete-branch-how-to-for-both-local-and-remote
-basic branch delete in local repo
git branch -d <branch-name>

-delete branch in local repo and its unmerged changes
git branch -D <branch-name>

-delete a remote branch
git push --delete <remote name> <branch name>
